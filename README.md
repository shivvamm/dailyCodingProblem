## Introduction

Technical interviews can be challenging, and practicing coding problems regularly is an excellent way to enhance your problem-solving abilities and boost your confidence. This repository aims to provide you with a daily dose of coding problems that are frequently encountered during interviews at various tech companies.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is designed to be user-friendly and accessible. Here's how you can make the most out of it:

1. **Daily Problems**: A new coding problem will be posted daily in the [Issues](https://github.com/shivvamm/dailyCodingProblem/issues) section. You can view the problem statement, try to solve it on your own, and participate in discussions about potential solutions.

2. **Problem Archive**: All previously posted problems will be organized in the [Problem](https://github.com/shivvamm/dailyCodingProblem/tree/main/Problems) directory. Feel free to browse and tackle any problem at your own pace.

3. **Solutions**: Solutions to the daily coding problems will be shared in the [Solutions](https://github.com/shivvamm/dailyCodingProblem/tree/main/Solutions) directory. These solutions are provided in various programming languages, so you can compare different approaches and learn from others' solutions.

4. **Contributions**: You are encouraged to contribute your own solutions to the problems or suggest improvements to existing solutions. Please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines on how to contribute.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome! If you have a solution to a problem that's not already in the repository or if you want to improve an existing solution, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name, like `feature/add-solution-<problem-number>`.

3. Add your solution to the appropriate directory inside the [solutions](https://github.com/shivvamm/dailyCodingProblem/tree/main/Solutions) folder. Please provide clear comments and follow the style of existing solutions.

4. If you're contributing a new problem, add it to the [Issues](https://github.com/shivvamm/dailyCodingProblem/issues) section with the "Problem" label.

5. Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch. Add a clear description of your changes in the PR.

6. Your PR will be reviewed, and once approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

Let's build this resource together and create a valuable collection of coding problems and solutions!

## Problem Format

Each problem will be presented as a Markdown file with the following structure:
```
### Problem Title

Problem description and any additional information about the problem.

### Example
Input: [describe input if applicable]
Output: [describe output if applicable]

[Additional examples if necessary]

### Constraints
[List any constraints or limitations of the problem not always necessary]

### Notes
[Any additional notes, hints, or tips]
```

## Solutions

Solutions to the problems can be found in the [solutions](https://github.com/your-username/daily-coding-problems/tree/main/solutions) directory. Each problem's solution will be provided in different programming languages for reference.
